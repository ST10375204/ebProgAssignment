## Description

eBProgAssignment is a simple web application/prototype for AgriConnect that allows farmers and employees to list, view, and manage agricultural products. Users can filter products through an integrated Dialogflow chatbot and perform CRUD operations based on their role.

## Features

* **Role-Based Access**: Farmers can create, update, and delete their own products; Employees can view and delete any product and create new users
* **Product Listing**: Display products in a responsive card layout.
* **Chatbot Filtering**: Integrate Dialogflow Messenger for natural language filtering (`equals`, `less than`, `greater than`, and `contains`).
* **Image Support**: Upload or link product images.
* **Confirmation Prompts**: JavaScript confirmation for delete operations.

## Technologies Used

* ASP.NET Core MVC
* Entity Framework Core (Code First)
* SQL Server
* Dialogflow Messenger
* Razor Pages & Bootstrap 5
* JSON Serialization (System.Text.Json)

## Prerequisites

* [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
